# How is a Nylas ID different from my email address?

Your Nylas ID allows you to manage your Nylas subscription. You can have as many mailboxes and email addresses as you like within N1, but your Nylas ID allows our team to keep track of your subscription and address your support requests. In the future, your Nylas ID will be your common identity across Nylas products.

If you’re using N1 against our open source sync engine, you’ll still need to create a Nylas ID. You don’t need to upgrade to a paid plan, and the app will not run in trial mode. On the subscription tab, you’ll see “You are not upgraded to Nylas Pro.” Note that Pro features, like read receipts, link tracking, and send later, do not work with the open source version of the Nylas platform.
