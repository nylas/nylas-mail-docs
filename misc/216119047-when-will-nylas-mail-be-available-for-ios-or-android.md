# When will Nylas Mail be available for iOS or Android?

The Nylas Mail client is built on Electron and designed to be cross-platform. It's written in JavaScript, so it's easy to run on Mac, Windows and Linux. However, this set of technologies doesn't translate easily to mobile. Nylas Mail for iOS or Android would need to be an entirely separate companion product designed for those operating systems and form factors.

We may ship Nylas Mail for iOS and Android in the future, but we're currently focused on shipping a best-in-class desktop product. Stay tuned!
